 * Recovers from a playback start that never happens.
 *
 * The failure looks like this, captured while stuck: `readyState` 1,
 * `networkState` NETWORK_IDLE, `buffered` empty, duration known. The element
 * accepted `play()` and reports `paused === false`, but it is not fetching
 * anything, so `playing` never fires. Nothing settles the `play()` promise in
 * that state — it is neither an error nor an autoplay refusal — and the viewer
 * is left on a black frame.
 *
 * It happens because a second `load()` aborts the fetch the first one started:
 * the stored quality preference is restored once the new sources are in, and if it
 * does not match the source already loading, the swap kills the in-flight
 * request. Setting `preload` back to `auto` does not revive it; only re-running
 * the resource selection algorithm does. So that is the escalation: seek first,
 * since it is cheap and keeps the buffer, then reload, then give up.
